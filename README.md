During the **"Marine Data 4 Sustainable Oceans - Session #1"** workshop, organized by **Copernicus Marine Service** and **Mercator Ocean International**, an introduction was given on accessing free, open-source marine data covering physical, biogeochemical, and ice oceans, available in real-time, reanalysis, and forecasts. 

Tools like **My Ocean Viewer Pro** and **Ocean Monitoring Indicators (OMIs)** were presented to visualize and track the state of the ocean. Practical applications, such as **SIMRoute** for optimizing ship routes and **Oil Spill Trajectory Analysis**, demonstrated the use of marine data in reducing environmental impacts.

The workshop highlighted the importance of ocean reporting, with the **Annual State of the Ocean Report** as a key scientific reference. Resources, including **Jupyter Notebook tutorials**, were offered to facilitate data use via Python APIs and the **Copernicus Marine Toolbox**.
